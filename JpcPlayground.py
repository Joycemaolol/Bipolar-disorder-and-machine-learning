## - Import the dataset properly

Mydata = pd.read_csv('/Users/julienchanel/Documents/GitHub/data/scores.csv')
Mydata

## - Show dataset and create new columns with two existing variables

Mydata.info()
Mydata['Average madrs'] = ((Mydata.madrs2 + Mydata.madrs1)/2)
Mydata

## - Normalize the data [xnormalized = (x - xminimum) / range of x]

## - Plot the activity dataset (Q. How to import activity for all conditions (as their in seperate files). Does this mean we'll have to do our analysis from condition to condition?)

Activity1 = pd.read_csv('/Users/julienchanel/Documents/GitHub/data/condition/condition_1.csv')
Activity1

Activity1_plot = plt.rcParams['figure.figsize']
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (14,4)
Activity1.plot(x='timestamp', y=['activity'], kind='line', xlabel='Time')
plt.title('Condition 1, Motor Activity')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = Activity1_plot

## - Find the length of “0” motion(a range, maybe 0-5) for each patient each day, for unipolar, bipolar, and healthy controls. For each patient, plot a graph: x asis: day, y axis: amount of time with no movement

## - Find the “maximum” motion for each patient each day, for unipolar, bipolar, and healthy controls. For each patient, plot a graph: x asis: day, y axis: amount of time with no movement

## - Find the “Mean (Average)” motion for each patient each day, for unipolar, bipolar, and healthy controls. For each patient, plot a graph: x asis: day, y axis: amount of time with no movement

Ac1Sum = sum(Activity1.activity)
Activity1['AverageMotion'] = (Ac1Sum/Activity1.count())

Activity1
AverageMotion_plot = plt.rcParams['figure.figsize']
AverageMotion_plot(x='AverageMotion')

## - Find the “standard deviation” motion for each patient each day, for unipolar, bipolar, and healthy controls. For each patient, plot a graph: x asis: day, y axis: amount of time with no movement

## - Learn how to encode data: change categorical data into numerical data
