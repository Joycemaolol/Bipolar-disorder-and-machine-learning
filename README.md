Bipolar disorder, especially bipolar II disorder, is known to have a high suicide and self-harm rate, and a high misdiagnosis rate. This project is an attempt to identify patients with bipolar II disorder among a group of healthy controls and patients with major depressive disorder. We use the motor activity data collected by the motion-sensitive sensor at Haukland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway and applied a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network with corresponding accuracies of 63.48% and 75.7% respectively.
